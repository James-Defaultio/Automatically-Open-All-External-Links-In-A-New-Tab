Auto Target Blank

This script makes every link that links to external sites open in a new tab so your traffic can stay on your site. 

It does this by automatically adding the attribute target with the value "_blank" (target="_blank") to all links that link to external websites and the attribute target with the value "self" to all links that link to your own site. examples:

`<a href="https://linkstoothersite.com" target="_bank">Links to other site</a>`

`<a href="linkstoownsite.html" target="self">Links to own site</a>`

Automating this will save you so much time as you will not have to do this manually everytime you add a link to your site, and in so doing eliminates all room human error in this regard.

To use, simply copy the code below and add it to your head element.

`<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dacodmagagula/auto_target_blank/master/auto_target_blank.js"></script>`

Or download the file `auto_target_blank.js` from this link `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dacodmagagula/auto_target_blank/master/auto_target_blank.js` and use it locally.

Happy coding!!!
