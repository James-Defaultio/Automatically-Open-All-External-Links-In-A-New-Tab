Auto Target Blank

This script makes every link that links to external sites open in a new tab so your traffic can stay on your site. 

It does this by automatically adding the attribute target with the value "_blank" (target="_blank") to all links that link to external websites and the attribute target with the value "self" to all links that link to your own site. examples:

`<a href="https://linkstoothersite.com" target="_bank">Links to other site</a>`

`<a href="linkstoownsite.html" target="self">Links to own site</a>`

Automating this will save you so much time as you will not have to do this manually everytime you add a link to your site. It also eliminates all room human error.

To use, simply copy the code below and add it to your head element.

You can also download the file and use it locally.

Happy coding!!!
